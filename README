xawk: awk for xml
hawk: awk for html

(you need to run yapps xawk_grammar.g before running the programs (you
might need to apt-get install yapps2 before you do that))

Both accept a language that looks a bit like awk. Very limited so far
but try:

curl www.bbc.co.uk | ./hawk links.xawk | lynx -stdin
