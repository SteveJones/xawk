* Awk like
  <xpath> { actions }

  Default action is print the whole match.

  Break from awk in that actions are executed in order.

  Action without an xpath is always evaluated.

  Because XML is a tree, actions can be nested with the special match
  action. i.e. [matchers]

  Some actions:
  - print ::With no args prints the current node. With unquoted args
    treats them as xpaths from the current node. With " quoted args
    treat as strings and print.

** Examples
   Make a new document containing only the links from the input.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   / {
     print "<html><head><title>" html/head/title "</title></head><body><ul>";
     [//a {
       print "<li>" .;
     }]
     print "</ul></body></html>"
   }
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Get the sum of all the price nodes in a document:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   cat bookstore.xml | ./xawk.py -e '{ print sum(//price); }'

** Grammar
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   program := matcher+.
   matcher := xpath_actions | actions | xpath_default.
   xpath_actions := xpath actions.
   xpath_default := xpath ";".
   xpath := /[^{]\S*/.
   actions := "{" action+ "}".
   action := command arg+ ";" | "[" matcher+ "]".
   command := "print".
   arg := xpath | string.
   string := "\"" /([^"]|\\")*/ "\"".
#+END_EXAMPLE
